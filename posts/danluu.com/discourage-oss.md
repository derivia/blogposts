 **How to discourage open source contributions** | [Patreon](https://patreon.com/danluu)

What's the first thing you do when you find a bug or see a missing feature in an open source project? Check out the project page and submit a patch!

Oh. Maybe their message is so encouraging that they get hundreds of pull requests a week, and the backlog isn't that bad.

Maybe not. Giant sucker than I am, I submitted a pull request even after seeing that. All things considered, I should consider myself lucky that it's possible to [submit pull requests at all](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/02/wow-remember-when-people-tracked-bugs-welcome-to-the-next-level/). If I'm really lucky, maybe they'll get around to [looking at it one day](http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html).

I don't mean to pick on this particular project. I can understand how this happens. You're a dev who can merge pull requests, but you're not in charge of triaging bugs and pull requests; you have a day job, projects that you own, and a life outside of coding. Maybe you take a look at the repo every once in a while, merge in good pull requests, and make comments on the ones that need more work, but you don't look at all 116 open pull requests; who has that kind of time?

 

This behavior, eminently reasonable on the part of any individual, results in a systemic failure, a tax on new open source contributors. I often get asked how to get started with open source. It's easy for me to forget that getting started can be hard because the first projects I contributed to have a response time measured in hours for issues and pull requests[1](#fn:1). But a lot of people have experiences which aren't so nice. They contribute a few patches to a couple projects that get ignored, and have no idea where to go from there. It doesn't take [egregious individual behavior](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/12/14/dear-open-source-project-leader-quit-being-a-jerk/) to create a hostile environment.

 

That's kept me from contributing to some projects. At my last job, I worked on making a well-known open source project production quality, fixing hundreds of bugs over the course of a couple months. When I had some time, I looked into pushing the changes back to the open source community. But when I looked at the mailing list for the project, I saw a wasteland of good patches that were completely ignored, where the submitter would ping the list a couple times and then give up. Did it seem worth spending a week to disentangle our IP from the project in order to submit a set of patches that would, in all likelihood, get ignored? No.

 

If you have commit access to a project that has this problem, please [own the process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility) for incoming pull requests (or don't ask for pull requests in your repo description). It doesn't have to permanent; just until you have a system in place[2](#fn:2). Not only will you get more contributors to your project, you'll help break down one barrier to becoming an open source contributor.

1. Props to [OpenBlas](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS), [Rust](https://github.com/mozilla/rust), [jslinux-deobfuscated](https://github.com/levskaya/jslinux-deobfuscated), and [np](https://github.com/softprops/np) for being incredibly friendly to new contributors. [[return]](#fnref:1)
2. I don't mean to imply that this is trivial. It can be hard, if your project doesn't have an accepting culture, but there are [popular, high traffic projects that manage to do it](http://paulmillr.com/posts/github-pull-request-stats/). If all else fails, you can always try [the pull request hack](http://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html). [[return]](#fnref:2)
